## About
FitGenie is an AI based gym assister which assists people who prefer home workouts. Insttead of going to gym, this gym assister helps people to do exercises correctly and also counts the number of sets and reps. Users can create their own at-home regimen by choosing from a library of exercises. They can then use their webcams to check the quality of their form using the app's feedback.This can be a great help to people who cannot afford to go to gym or do not go due to some personal reasons.

## How we built it
We have built this application using OpenCV, Mediapipe for capturing and visualizing the exercises of the user. This python web application was hosted using streamlit and deployed in Heroku. 

 ## What we Learned
 
 We have learnt about opencv, mediapipe tools for computer vision. We have learnt about streamlit and how to host python applications in streamlit. 


 ## What can be Improved?
 
One of the improvements is that we could add a feature such that users can be able to add their wn type of exercises, so that they will not be limited to the exercises that we have provided.

One camera being attached at a time was one of the main problems we ran across because it limited the number of workouts we could perform. This is crucial and an enhancement because it allows us to add new workouts and let the user choose how to train without having to adjust the camera.
